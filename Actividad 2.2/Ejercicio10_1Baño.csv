To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

I love to experience new places, new foods and meet new people.   Having lived in Brazil, Japan, Thailand and many years here in the United States I appreciate diverse viewpoints and customs.    Getting helpful insight from friendly locals makes any stay so much richer.

For my day job, I develop multifamily housing.   I am interested in creating living solutions that allow residents to pursue their passions and interests while having a smaller environmental footprint.    To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

As a father of five, I am a family man.   I appreciate the challenges and joys of travelling with family.    My wife and I took our children down the Silk Road on a 3 week hand carry only trip.

I love to experience new places, new foods and meet new people.   Having lived in Brazil, Japan, Thailand and many years here in the United States I appreciate diverse viewpoints and customs.    Getting helpful insight from friendly locals makes any stay so much richer.

For my day job, I develop multifamily housing.   I am interested in creating living solutions that allow residents to pursue their passions and interests while having a smaller environmental footprint.    To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

As a father of five, I am a family man.   I appreciate the challenges and joys of travelling with family.    My wife and I took our children down the Silk Road on a 3 week hand carry only trip.   Getting good local advice can be critical to making a stay pleasant and rewarding for every member of the family.
